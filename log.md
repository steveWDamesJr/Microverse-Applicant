# 100 Days of Code - Log
### Day 0: May 25th, 2021

**TodayÂ´s Progress**: Updated Gallery page of mighty-students of Greenhill (HTML, CSS, Javascript project) project using grid to adjust columns for an alternating text/image page, flex-end on img, padding tools crading in CSS, global variable to change background color of a section; Gallery page now populated with content.

**Thoughts:** After organizing my work outlook and focusing on only one task of the architectural masterpiece that is a website, I was able to accomplish the small goal that I set out to complete. I hope to be finished with this build so that I can start a new project in the coming days.
